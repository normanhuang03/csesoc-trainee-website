                            My hobbies include sports like basketball 🏀, badminton 🏸 and cross-country 🏃‍♂
                            as well as other random niches like sunsets, origami and mini-legos! My sunset
                            recommendation spot would be Kissing Point Park :) Over there are many paths
                            which extend out into the water, allowing you to see the sunset in many
                            different directions! 🌇

                            I have a cavoodle named Mocha 🐶 and her favourite activities are tummy rubs
                            and sleeping next to people in my family. She's ecstatic, always looking to
                            get a bite of human food when we eat and also waits patiently by the front
                            when there's no one home 😭

                        <p>
                        This is one of the best places I've eaten at recently, it's called Poly! And
                        located in Surry Hills. In the above image you can see their deep fried potato
                        with a salted egg yolk crust 😋 I would give it a solid 9.5/10 🤩 Some of the
                        other delicious foods include their potato bread, oysters and roasted cabbage!

                    <h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica;">I like exploring different places</h3>
                        <p>
                        One of my favourite things to do is spontaneously go to vibey places,
                        especially at night to walk around, explore and grab a bite or drink 🏙
                        The Sydney CBD is one of my favourite spots! Depending on my mood I like to
                        do different things like visiting the arcade or getting a drink to watch
                        street performances.

                        <p>
                        Nothing hits the same as KFC and/or bubble tea 🤤 My go-to orders are 6
                        wicked wings at KFC and/or lychee oolong with aloe and white pearls (AND NO
                        ICE) at Gong Cha ❗ P.S. did I say no ice¿ 😁

                        <p>
                        On a more serious note, I am a driven and hard-working individual who is
                        looking to learn more about computer science, and what better way than
                        surrounding myself with much more skilled and like-minded individuals
                        whilst being trained/working on a project? I hope to be mentored and work
                        effectively with other CSESoc members to acquire countless skills and build
                        genuine and meaningful relationships from the Trainee Program. My end goal
                        is to be a part of the Projects Team to work on a flagship project! 🎯
